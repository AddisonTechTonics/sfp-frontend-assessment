### Functionality of Application
Here is how the application must function:
- Genres to include: Action, Animation, Crime, Drama, Fantasy, Horror.
- Movies should populate from the API.
- When a genre or pagination button is clicked, a request should be sent to the API, and then repopulate the movie list.

### General Requirements
- Webpage must **NOT** use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.
- Webpage **must be responsive**. Its mobile look is up to you.
- JavaScript will be used heavily. You may use either Vue, React, Angular, jQuery or vanilla JavaScript. Vue.js is highly recommended as that is our choice of framework.

### API Use
First, you must [login](https://www.themoviedb.org/login) or [create an account](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) with TMDb.
To get TMDb API token, visit the API tab in your [account settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
Once you have landed on the API details page, click to generate an API key at the bottom of the page.

You will need to figure out on your own how to use the API token, as well as what routes you need to use.
